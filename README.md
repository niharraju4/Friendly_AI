ðŸš€ Built a RAG Conversational AI App with OpenAI GPT, MongoDB & JWT Authentication!
I'm excited to share a project that integrates OpenAI GPT models for dynamic, multi-mode conversations. The app features secure user authentication, multi-language support, and we had designed AI Therapist, Maple the Guinea Pig, German tutor.

ðŸ’¡ Project Overview:
This Flask-based app combines RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 to deliver context-aware conversations stored in MongoDB. The app includes:
AI Therapist: A supportive AI for therapy-like conversations where users can express their thoughts.
Maple, the Guinea Pig: A playful companion for fun, interactive chats.
German Tutor: An AI tutor offering real-time translations and replies in both English and German.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
User Authentication:
Secure login using Bcrypt and JWT tokens for session management.
Multi-Mode Conversations:
AI Therapist: Engages users in thoughtful, supportive dialogues.
Maple, the Guinea Pig: Fun, light-hearted conversations.
German Tutor: Provides real-time English-to-German translations.
Voice Interaction:
Voice-enabled interaction using speech recognition and text-to-speech in all modes.
Session Management:
Conversation history is stored in MongoDB, providing multi-turn conversations that retain context.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
Flask for backend development
OpenAI GPT-4 & GPT-3.5 Turbo for AI-driven responses
MongoDB for session data and conversation storage
JWT for secure session management
Bcrypt for password encryption
ðŸš€ What I Learned:
Building a multi-modal conversational AI for therapy, fun, and language learning.
Implementing JWT for session security and speech-based interaction for dynamic conversations.
Managing conversation history with MongoDB for personalized responses.
